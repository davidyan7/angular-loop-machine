## Loop machine app

## Description
The Grooveo loop machine allows users to create a simple musical piece with ease.  To create their piece, users can choose from nine different audio fragments and combine them to their liking. Choosing to play a fragment, or to stop playing one, can be done by clicking the audio fragment’s button, which toggles between the on and off options. As easy as it gets! 
Once audio fragments are selected, pressing on the “Play” button will play all selected audio fragment simultaneously in a loop. Users can modify their selection while the piece is being played. Selection of additional, previously not selected, audio fragment while the Grooveo loop machine is working will add the new audio fragment to the next loop. However, omitting an audio fragment that is currently playing will immediately stop it from playing. 
All the choices that are made by the user are stored in the local storage. Once users choose their desired combination of audio fragments, they can save their musical piece by clicking on the “Record” button. A new “Stop Record” button will then appear and can be used to stop the recording. To play the recorded piece, users can click on the “Play Record” button.
